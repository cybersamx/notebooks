# Notebooks

Data science and AI are becoming increasingly important and relevant in the industry. I am not a data scientist nor do I claim to be an expert in data science. This is a project I started to learn, appreciate, and capture some basic concepts in data science and AI in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

* Basics
  * [CSV import](basics/csv_import.ipynb)
* Plot
  * [Scatter plot](plots/scatter.ipynb)
* Machine Learning
  * [Training and test datasets](ml/train_test_data.ipynb)
  * [Simple classification](ml/simple_classifiers.ipynb)
  * [Perceptron](ml/perceptron.ipynb)
